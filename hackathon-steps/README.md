# GitHub <> Expedia Innersource Hackathon

> for maximum dramatic effect... listen [to this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxNGMvNIvP8) while reading this intro 💪😎

Acme Engineering is prepping their biggest launch to date, a [multiplayer snake battle royale experience](https://acme-hackathon.herokuapp.com). You're tasked with taking the coding efforts of just one engineering team, and Innersourcing a fork of the source code for **all of** Acme, and soon, the **open source community** to learn from.

You and your Hackathon competition have early access to [The Game](https://acme-hackathon.herokuapp.com), the Tenants Of Innersourcing, and ~4 hours to get this thing ready for _launch day_...

This project will cover our Innersourcing fundamentals, and will take this jumble of source code to a real Innersourced Repo, with GitHub Pages enabled, CI/CD automation with Azure Pipelines, GitHub Apps, and even Automated Security fixes...all running on your own personal GitHub fork of **The Game**.

Prizes will be awarded, and each team will be highlighted for their work!

 .. oh, we forgot to mention, you're also staffed with the naming of this thing. Prizes for the best Game Name 😉
